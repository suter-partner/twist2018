# TWIST2018 - Zurich's big 5 <i>!</i>

This project & the website were realized 2018 at the first [TWIST2018](https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/portal/de/index/ogd/anwendungen/2018/TWIST2018.html) Hackdays 25/08 & 26/08 as part of the [Swiss Statistics Meeting 2018](https://statistiktage.ch/en/)

**See this repository (project website) [here in action Â»](https://su-pa.net/twist2018)**

The team spent two **good!interesting** days trying out and using **LOSD & SPARQL** (Linked Open Statistical Data & SPARQL Protocol And RDF Query Language). Our project gives people from abroad the possibility to find out as a result of 5 sortable criteria which quarter of Zurich fits best their personal needs.

It may be useful for you to do first steps with **LOSD & SPARQL** and get some information about [**Open Data** of the City of Zurich](https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/)
